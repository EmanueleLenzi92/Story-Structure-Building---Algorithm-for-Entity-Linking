ALMO alp oxen	The MOVING reference member state of this VC (Value Chain) is AUSTRIA. The reference MOVING Card ID of this VC is VC 01 AT. ALMO is a label for quality ox products and the lead product of the region. 'ALMO' (Almo Steirisches Almochsenfleisch) is protected as word mark. The Association Steirische Bergland Marktgemeinschaft comprises approx. 500 farmers, who own the brand, and raise ca. 3.000 oxen per year ALMO is marketed via Almenland Marketing GmbH, only three retail partners are allowed to sell ALMO, but nearly all regional restaurants offer the meat. All farmers participate in the Austrian Program for Environmentally Sound Agriculture (ÖPUL), 10 % are organic. Close connection to regional development and relevance for (agro-)tourism (Urlaub am Bauernhof) positive impacts Lead product of the 'Genussregion Almenland' ( region of culinary delight : promoting local food specialities; quality standards set by the AgrarMarkt Austria). The cooperation between the farmers association and business partners is on eye level, and implies unusual contracts, such as guaranteed prices independent from the market prices. Moreover, quality standards are developed in cooperation between farmers and business partners.

Interest on this VC	ALMO is an alp oxen farmers association with about 500 members. The registered brand is owned by the farmers association. ALMO is the lead high quality product of the LEADER-region Almenland and Energieregion Weiz-Gleisdorf , and well embedded into the regional development. ALMO is based on traditional pasture framing, and characterised by exceptionally high animal welfare standards (cooperation with an Austrian animal welfare NGO). Through the cooperation between farmers and with other value chain actors (veterinaries, butchers, retailers, tourism, regional development agency) several innovations emerged. The initiative is driven by special relationships of the initiators with other value chain actors, well embedded into the regional development, tourism and local culture. Business relations are exceptional (e.g. purchase and price guarantee), partly based on personal relationships and trust. The initiative combines an originally traditional practice with very innovative elements, which are continuously further developed.
Key local assets	* own regional slaughter house (cooperation with sheep farmers, free range pig farmers, local butcher) enhances the regional value creation * close connection with regional development: ALMO serving as lead product * considerable contribution to the preservation of the landscape: the landscape plays an important role for (hiking) tourism in the region * pasture farming has a tradition over centuries - being part of the regional identity. 
Challenges	Predicted changes in climate (extrem weather conditions: drough, heavy rain) are likely to have effects on the feedbase for this pasture based meat production as the vegetation might change, and the cultivation of feed for the winter time might change as well. An increasing wastage of alpine pasture areas might demand in future for adjusting the pasture intensity and to significantly improve the quality of the forage plant growth. Many of the ALMO producers are small scale, women led farms. They are economically very vulnerable, if the stable price arrangements can not be kept up, their income security is at risk. Overall the type of challenge faced by this VC is Current and Predicted. This VC is classified as Traditional and Innovative.
Innovation	The type of innovation of this VC (Value Chain) is Endogenous and Exogenous. Many innovations, especially their implementation, were/are based on social relations and engage various actors within the VC. Drivers for innovations have always been members of the initiative and the network it is embedded in: due to its embeddedness into the broader regional development initiatives, ALMO key persons work together with others in local action groups, which have been set up within LEADER for different projects. This leads to a cross-sectoral exchange of ideas and insights into various fields of broader regional development concept. Most innovations resulted from different actors bringing in different knowledge and different expertise. E.g. specific feeding practices (in order to achieve a very high meat quality) have been developed by the farmers in cooperation with one of the business partners, and a consultant (innovation based practice and academic knowledge). Another example is the building of stables: one of the farmers, who had to build a new free-range stable, had seen such stables somewhere else, and developed an adaptation of this type for the Almenland region. Many of the other farmers rebuilt their stables according to his model ( System Haberl ). The innovation is related to New processes and New marketing strategies. The land use systems involved are pasture farming. The local assets include Natural, social and cultural.
Concluding remarks	A few for ALMO producing farmers come from other, neighbouring regions: Lower Austria (NUTS-II AT 12) and Carinthia (NUTS-II AT 21). There are no similar initiatives for alp oxen, but several other marketing initiatives (quality labels) for pasture farmed beef in Austria. Still, the specific organisational structure and partnerships within the VC are unique.
